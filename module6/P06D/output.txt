A void function does not return the value. Call by reference or pointer would need to be used with a void function 
so that the variable is not local. In this example, there is no way for quantity to leave the function and go back
to main. We can change it to call by refence, or make a pointer. Alternatively, we can change this to an int function
and return quantity.
